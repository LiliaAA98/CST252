        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <p class="c">I had challenges with the quotations mark and grammer rather than with the code 
            itself it was more of tiny errors rather than the actual code
        </p>

    <div id="Problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p class="c"> A problem that came up a couple of the times was the " I would
            put the quotation marks but since they were slanted it didnt work with the 
            code they need to be straight down.
            I also struggled with github in general it said my permission was revoked
             for some reason but after meeting with Lumas they helped me fix the problem.
        </p>

    <div id="Results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p class="c">The results I got was the change in events when the Button turns pink with the Click
            and the 2nd button turning green with the mouseover
        </p>
